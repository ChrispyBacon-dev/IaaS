# IaaS Project Concept: Self-Hosted Docker Environment

## 1. Core Goal

The primary objective is to create a resilient and flexible Docker hosting environment that is:

*   **Host Independent:** Easily migrate applications or recover the setup without depending on specific physical or virtual host servers.
*   **Disaster Recovery Friendly:** Simplify the process of restoring services and data in case of a host failure.

## 2. Key Technologies & Components

*   **Host Operating System:** Ubuntu Server (as the base for Docker hosts).
*   **Containerization:** Docker (to run applications in isolated environments).
*   **Container Management:** [Komo.do](http://Komo.do) (UI/tool for managing Docker containers and deployments).
*   **Configuration Management (Host Setup):** Ansible (to automate the preparation of new Ubuntu host servers).
*   **Secure Internal Networking:** Tailscale (to create a private, secure network connecting all host servers and potentially management nodes).
*   **Shared Application Data Store:** Google Drive accessed via `rclone` (mounted on hosts to provide a common, cloud-backed storage location for persistent Docker application data).
    *   *Initial thought mentioned Google Cloud Datastore - clarification needed if this is still considered or replaced by Google Drive/rclone.*
*   **Monitoring:** Netdata (deployed as a Docker container for real-time host and container metrics).
*   **Secure External Access / Reverse Proxy:** Cloudflare Tunnel, automated via the custom `DockFlare` project. https://github.com/ChrispyBacon-dev/DockFlare
*   **Version Control:** Private GitHub Repository (to store and manage all control files, including Ansible playbooks, Docker configurations, scripts, etc.).
*   **Basic Access:** SSH (for direct command-line access to host servers when needed).

## 3. Workflow & Architecture Overview

1.  **Provision Host:** Start with a clean Ubuntu Server instance.
2.  **Configure Host via Ansible:** Run Ansible playbooks against the new host to:
    *   Ensure SSH is configured securely.
    *   Install Docker engine.
    *   Install and configure the Tailscale client, joining it to the designated Tailnet.
    *   Install `rclone` and configure it to access the shared Google Drive. Potentially set up systemd units to mount the drive automatically.
3.  **Deploy Management & Core Services:**
    *   Use Komo.do (or manual Docker commands/compose initially) to deploy core infrastructure containers:
        *   `Netdata` container for monitoring.
        *   The `DockFlare` container/service.
4.  **Deploy Applications:**
    *   Use Komo.do to deploy application containers.
    *   Configure application containers requiring persistent or shared data to use volumes mapped to the `rclone` Google Drive mount point.
5.  **Expose Services:**
    *   Configure the `DockFlare` service to automatically detect specified running containers and create/manage Cloudflare Tunnels to expose them securely to the internet (handling HTTPS and reverse proxying).
6.  **Maintain Configuration:** All Ansible playbooks, `rclone` setup scripts, potentially Docker Compose files (if used alongside Komo.do), and `DockFlare` configurations are stored and version-controlled in the private GitHub repository.

## 4. Key Implementations & Tools

*   **Cloudflare Tunnel Automation:** Utilize the custom project `DockFlare` available at:
    *   `https://github.com/ChrispyBacon-dev/DockFlare`
    *   Purpose: Automate the creation and management of Cloudflare Tunnels based on running Docker containers, simplifying secure public exposure.
*   **Shared Storage Mechanism:** Rely on `rclone` to bridge the gap between Docker hosts and Google Drive, providing a centralized location for data that needs to survive container/host restarts or replacements.

## 5. Benefits Achieved

*   **Decoupling:** Applications and their data are decoupled from individual hosts thanks to the shared `rclone`/Google Drive storage.
*   **Simplified DR:** To recover, provision a new host using Ansible, connect it to Tailscale, mount the `rclone` drive, and redeploy containers via Komo.do. Data remains intact on Google Drive.
*   **Automation:** Ansible automates host setup; `DockFlare` automates external access.
*   **Security:** Tailscale secures internal traffic; Cloudflare Tunnels secure external access without opening firewall ports.
*   **Centralized Control:** Configuration lives in GitHub. Komo.do provides a management interface.

This summary should serve as a good reminder of the project's concept, goals, and the interplay between the chosen components.
